**TIL (Today I Learned)**

Just my own personal repo where I track the things I learned in a given day. This was inspired by [Thoughtbot's repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), but I wanted to make it more of a daily thing rather than grouped by categories. At some point, it'd be good to build a webapp for this.
