You don't need to ask permission to do a good job - Pete Hodgson
------------------------------------------

* That's a quote from iPhreaks where Pete is defending unit tests. "Unit testing is part of building good quality software. If you're not doing that, it's your fault."
* My coworker is deleting all of our branches from a project since they are unnecessary. We can do it one by one, or we can do it with a fancy command like `git for-each-ref --format="%(refname:short)" refs/heads/3.2\* | xargs git branch -D`. We also prefix our branches with our initials, so deleting all of a person's branches is a cinch.

* Adobe Flash: Mobile last design :D
* ng-animate is magic. We were trying to figure out why it wasn't working. Turns out you need to have a CSS transition property for it to add/remove its classes. Without it, it does nothing.
* Huh, I used to be able to quit finder with `defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem -bool true`, but that doesn't seem to work anymore.
* It's a glorious day. I just got my git autocompletions in ZSH working again. Since I'm using `hub`, I need to add `fpath=(usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath)` to the top of my .zshrc. I did disable the oh-my-zsh Github plugin, but wasn't sure it was doing anything anyway.
* Actually figured out how to do recurring payments in ActiveMerchant. It was buried in the source code, so I got it to send the right parameters. Need to make sure that you set `options[:billing_agreement][:type]` to "Recurring Payments".
