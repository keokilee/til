CSS Transforms are Crazy
=======================

* I'm starting to take a closer look at our design team's CSS and I occasionally see something new. Today, it is `backface-visibility`. The background of an element is typically opaque, but this rule can make it transparent. Of course, this is only useful in 3D transforms. Can't wait to check out what they put together.
