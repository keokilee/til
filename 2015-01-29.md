Better <insert thing here>
--------------------------

Some stuff yesterday that I forgot to jot down.
=============

* [Better Specs](http://betterspecs.org) provides some succinct examples on writing specs. I read the RSpec book and can recommend it, but this is a good cheat sheet.
* [Thoughtbot Playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/) - I bookmarked this a long time ago and I still haven't read it.  Thoughtbot is a consultancy, so there is a lot of content in here regarding working with clients. I really need to read this because it's chock full of lessons learned.


New Stuff
===========

* [The Impostor Syndrome](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-imposter-syndrome-9e23e2326d88) by Julie Zhuo. Really powerful stuff.
* Just needed to watch something in Angular while using controllerAs. It is a little convoluted, but here is the [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24078535/angularjs-controller-as-syntax-and-watch) example.
