Multi-column Indexes and You
===========================

I just learned this today while perusing a presentation from RailsConf. When specifying a multi-column index (typically on id and a type column in a polymorphic relation), the order of the index should be (type, id). This index is optimized for queries like "type = 'foo' AND id = 1" and "type = 'foo'", but not for "id = 1". See the [Postgres docs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/indexes-multicolumn.html) for more information on this. Similar language exists in the [MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/multiple-column-indexes.html).
