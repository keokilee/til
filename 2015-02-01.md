Super Bowl Sunday!!!
===================

* Watching Eran Hammer talk about Hapi 8. Has promises and some other cool features.
* Realms in Hapi 8: Sandbox plugins to their own ecosystem completely. Define things that will not overlap with other plugins.
* Going through Addy Osmani's [Essential JS Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) book again. Lots of good stuff that I need to review.
