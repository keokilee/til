* Was listening to the Bikeshed podcast and they mentioned using `allow_value` from shoulda matchers when testing validations in Rails. The reason is that setting a value and then checking `valid?` might not catch issues if the model is invalid for other reasons.
* Trying to get a better understanding of Flux since we're using React/Reflux for a project. I found this [article](http://blog.andrewray.me/flux-for-stupid-people/) helped a lot. So it's dispatch event to central store, store updates, store notifies listeners that there was an update, listeners re-render. And thanks to the magic of React and Virtual DOM, re-rendering is cheap.
* Also just figured out how to set up namespaced Devise routes correctly. Actually, not sure if it's correct or if it's a hack. Mostly just:
```
devise_for :user do
  post 'api/v1/auth/sign_in' => 'sessions#create'
  ...
end
```
