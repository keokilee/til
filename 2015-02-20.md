After A Long-ish Break
======================

* I had actually never used `cattr_reader` in a Rails application until today.
* My tests are interacting with ActiveMerchant and the PayPal API. Sucks that the bogus gateway in ActiveMerchant does not implement the PayPal methods. There is a blog post that fixes this, but it is from 2012 and I do not want to have to deal with updates to ActiveMerchant. http://infotrope.net/2013/05/31/testing-paypal-express-with-activemerchants-bogusgateway-and-how-to-make-it-work/. Stub network requests, maybe?
