YAJSF (Yet Another JS Framework)
-------------------------------

* [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io): Seems cool and built with ES6 and ES7 in mind. Also uses [jspm](http://jspm.io).
* Coworker was explaining `display: inline-block`, which I intuitively understand, but he did a much better job of explaining it than I could. Block elements can expand beyond their container (width/height) and have margins/padding given to them. Block elements cannot be inlined with content though, so inline-block to the rescue!
* Spent a lot of time today working on recurring payments with  Paypal Express Checkout and ActiveMerchant. Looks like it does not work. :sadface:
