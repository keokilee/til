Fancy HTML5 Attributes
=====================

* Today, I needed to hide a div until some Javascript processed data. Typically, I'd show/hide with jQuery, but [Paul Irish says not to](https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/564443848613847040). While doing some research on alternatives, I found out about the [`hidden` attribute](http://davidwalsh.name/html5-hidden).
