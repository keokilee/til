Am I part of the problem?
====================

* ModelViewCulture has an [article](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-code-school-industrial-complex) on code schools and programming. For the most part, I believe we're one of the better schools out there in terms of preparing people for the tech industry. We're not perfect, and the article points out some things I can do as an instructor.
* Nailed a problem I was having with a Kendo grid and its click handler taking over a button's click handler. The trick was that the grid's handler triggered before the button's handler, so any `stopPropagation()` or `preventDefault()` tricks would not work. Ended up with something like:
```
var clicked = event.target && (event.target.tagName === "BUTTON");
clicked = clicked || (event.target.parentNode.tagName === "BUTTON");
```
Not the cleanest, but I tried really hard to avoid using jQuery as this is an Angular app.
* Was not sure if I could listen for an event from a child directive's isolate scope, but you can. The isolate scope's parent is still the parent controller, but the isolate scope does not inherit properties from the parent. It inherits from the basic scope prototype.
