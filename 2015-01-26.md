** The First TIL**

* Thoughtbot has a TIL repo. That is pretty cool. https://github.com/thoughtbot/til
* In GitHub Markdown, use double ~ to strikethrough text. Like, ~~strikethrough.~~
* Windows and Gemfiles - Install gem only for Windows using `platforms: [:mingw, :mswin]`. Exclude windows with `unless RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /win32/`
* Rails and the services folder. Great way to refactor without having a lot of code in your model or controller. https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/keeping-your-rails-controllers-dry-with-services
