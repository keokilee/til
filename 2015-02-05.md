Prototype (No Scriptaculous)
=========================

* I probably dated myself with the above reference. I'm reviewing design patterns and I'm looking at Addy Osmani's description of the prototype pattern. It has some ES5 syntax that I did not recognize, namely `Object.create` with property descriptors. Now you can have properties that cannot be deleted or modified without having to resort to a closure to encapsulate the variable. Pretty neat.
* Tom Dale posted an excellent blog post on why running your client side JS app on the server is NOT intended to replace your API server. Instead, it provides a more seamless experience as the user does not have to wait for the JS to download and execute. I like the idea, although I wonder how that impacts what server side technology you use.
