Another Compile to JS Language
=========================

* As if Dart wasn't enough, Google is working on [SoundScript](http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/soundscript.html). Details on it are pretty sparse at the moment as the only information on it is a blog post based on a Googler's talk.
* [Brunch](http://brunch.io/): yet another frontend build tool. I feel like I jumped on the Gulp bandwagon pretty early (about a year ago), so maybe it's time to jump on a new bandwagon? Or maybe just go to straight NPM scripts?
* Coworker just taught me about [constants](https://gist.github.com/demisx/9605099) in Angular. Really helpful because we have a few bits of code that need to use the `.erb` extension as they depend on assets from the Rails asset pipeline. With a constant, we can create a single `.js.erb` file that will contain all of the paths to assets in the asset pipeline.
