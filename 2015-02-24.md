Stub all the things
===================

* My frontend tests stopped running because one of the tests set the $window location to another URL. Looked up how to stub it and found [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14773269/injecting-a-mock-into-an-angularjs-service), which covers it. The approach is to override the `$window` dependency in the DI provider.
* Was just listening to the latest episode of iPhreaks on [coding standards](http://devchat.tv/iphreaks/093-ips-code-standards-in-swift-with-david-mauro). The argument for style guides are usually "just so that everyone gets on the same page", but they also mentioned the reduce cognitive overload of not having to deal with small choices like whether to put a semicolon in or not.
