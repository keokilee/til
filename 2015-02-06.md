CSS is the Worst
=================
* Another Example: https://discuss.atom.io/t/number-off-center-in-notification-bubble/14490
* Someone [flipped the switch](http://blog.nodejs.org/2015/02/06/node-v0-12-0-stable/) on Node 0.12, but it doesn't look like it includes any ES6 support. io.js is still the way to go?
* Going back to SoundScript, another [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2p58mpwToefRzlGMzRxTnhNb00/view) appeared. Seems like these are just experiments?
