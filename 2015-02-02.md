CSS and Wordpress are the WORST
===============================

* Did a lot of CSS today. I had assumed that Kendo grid would set `table-layout: fixed` for non-scrollable tables, but turns out I was wrong. That was pretty much my morning.
* I would like a table that would change its width if you change the width of a column. That would be most ideal.
* Also got some good use out of `git bisect` today. If you don't know it, you should. It's pretty rad.
* Coworker just showed me his ui-router setup for another project with nested/abstract routes. Pretty awesome.
* Designer just integrated Material Design in a subtle way. Love it. Will have to post it when it goes live.
