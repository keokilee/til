Quick and Easy Unix Utilities
=================

* Just used `rename` (`brew install rename` on OSX) to change the extension of my XML files from .xml to .txt so I can upload them in a support email. It uses the current folder, so the command I used was `rename 's/.xml/.txt/' *.xml`. Probably should make sure that `.xml` is at the end of the filename, but whatever.
